Detect real time emotions using computer vision and deep learning.

The Neural Network was trained on the 'fer2013' dataset which recognizes seven emotions i.e "Angry", "Disgust", "Fear", "Happy", "Sad", "Surprise" and "Neutral". The training and testing code is saved in 'trained_model_emotion.ipynb' file. This code gives a training accuracy of 66.8%, evaluation accuracy of 61.2% and test acuracy of 65.5%. The saved model is in 'final_weights.h5' file. This can be used directly with your code. The model is used to detect emotions on webcam video  using the 'cvvid.py' file.
